The year 2020 was full of surprises for all of us, for the most part, surprises that no one wanted. Be it Australia on fire to Covid 19 to the death of Tony Hsieh. This year will surely go down in history as the worst year of the 21st century.

People lost their jobs, and businesses shut down. But I was fortunate enough to have a job. But it didn’t come easy. So, here I look back and review what went wrong? and what went right?

### How 2020 went for me?

- I got my first internship as a Software Engineer. Jan - March
- In April, I got laid off from the internship as a combined result of Covid 19 and my performance during the internship.
- For the next two months (April - May), I kept learning and preparing for jobs as a Software Engineer.
- In June again got an internship in the same previous company.
- And after two months (June - July) of internship, this time I got a full time joining offer in August.
- And since then, I am working as a full-time Software Engineer.

So, 2020 went pretty well for me. It began with my first ever job, which I have till now. The only challenging part was that two months (April - May) halt in between.

### The halt of two months.

The halt of those two months was challenging but wasn’t that bad. It was a break from the rat race.

- I started writing.
- Thought of starting a startup.
- I started hosting sessions for developers with two of my friends. [Learnist](https://twitter.com/thelearnist). (Not active)
- I got active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codeSwastik).
- I started learning about entrepreneurship and finance.

It was two months of self-realization. I wanted to pursue entrepreneurship, build products, and never get back to a job. But, ended up having a job again due to financial issues at home.

### The financial mistake that I made.

This year I made money but didn’t save it, mostly due to the financial issues at home, but I could have saved a decent amount if I wanted. I know it is a huge mistake. To be financially independent, first, we need to save and then invest. Hence one of the major plans for 2021 is to make, save, and invest money.

Health is also a major focus for 2021. I didn’t care much for my mind and body this year, but gotta change that in 2021.

### Plans for 2021.

I always felt that I am not doing anything meaningful in a Job. And on top of that I recently read a book - [$100 StartUp](https://www.amazon.in/100-Startup-Reinvent-Living-Create/dp/0307951529) by [Chris Guillebeau](https://twitter.com/chrisguillebeau).
2021 is going to be the year of exploration and experiments. For the first time, I will be going all out on the journey of entrepreneurship and building, launching, and iterating over products.

- Focus on Health.
- Explore Entrepreneurship, Build products.
- Build an audience and reach 5k followers on Twitter.
- Get consistent in writing blogs.
- Get in touch with people who have made it big and learn from them.

I will be building a systematic approach to do all these things. As it is said: Fix the system, results will fix themselves.

I followed [DailyManifest](https://shop.visualizevalue.com/products/daily-manifest) for two weeks, and I think, for the most part, I will be following it in 2021.

That's how my 2020 went and my plans for 2021. Would love to know your plans for 2021 and how this year went for you.
