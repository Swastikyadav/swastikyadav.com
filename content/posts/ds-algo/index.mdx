## <a name="big-o-notation">Understanding Big O Notation</a>
Big O Notation is a way to represent the **time and space** complexity of an algorithm.

- Time Complexity: Time taken by the algorithm to complete the execution.
- Space Complexity: The memory occupied by the algorithm. 

![big-o-notation-cover](./algo-complexity.png)

There are few expressions (notations) which represents the time complexity of an algorithm.

- O(1): Constant time complexity. This is the ideal case.
- O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. If `log(n) = x` then it is same as `10^x`
- O(n): Linear time complexity. Time increases with the number of input in a linear manner. For ex, If one input takes 1 ms, 4 inputs will take 4 ms to execute the algo.
- O(n^2): Exponential time complexity. This mostly happens in case of nested loops.
- O(n!): Factorial time complexity. This is the worst case senario, which should be avoided.

You should try to write your algorithm such that it can be represented by the first 3 notations. And last two should be avoided as often as possible.

![o-notation-graph](./o-notation-graph.png)

You want to keep your complexity as low and straight as possible, ideally avoiding anything above O(n).

In further sections of this article you will see examples of each notation. For now this is all you need to know.

## Algorithm
### <a name="what-is-algo">What is algorithm and why to care?</a>
The way to solve a problem or we can say the **steps**, **procedure**, or **set of rules** to solve a problem is known as Algorithm.

<blockquote>ex: Search Engine algorithm to find out data related to a search string.</blockquote>

As a programmer you will come across many problems that needs to be solved with these algorithms. So, it's better if you already know them.

### <a name="recursion">Recursion</a>
A function calling itself is recursion. Think of it as an alternative to loop.

```js
function recursiveFn() {
	console.log("This is a recursive function");
	recursiveFn();
}

recursiveFn();
```
In the above snippet look at line 3 recursiveFn is called in recursiveFn itself. As I mentioned earlier recursion is an alternative to loop.

So, how many times this function is exactly going to run?

Well,  this will create an infinite loop, because there is nothing to stop it at any point.

![recursion-diagram](./recursivefn1.svg)

Let's say we need to run the loop only 10 times. On the 11th iteration function should return. That will stop the loop.

```js
let count = 1;
function recursiveFn() {
	console.log(`Recursive ${count}`);
	if (count === 10) return;
	count++;
	recursiveFn();
}

recursiveFn();
```
In the above snippet line 4 returns and stops the loop at count 10.

Now let's see a more realistic example. Our task is to return an array of odd numbers from a given array. This can be achieved in a number of ways including for-loop, Array.filter method, e.t.c

But to showcase the use of recursion I will use a helperRecursive function.

```js
function oddArray(arr) {
    let result = [];
    function helperRecursiveFn(arr) {
        if(arr.length === 0) {
            return; // 1
        } else if(arr[0] % 2 !== 0) {
            result.push(arr[0]); // 2
        }
        helperRecursiveFn(arr.slice(1)); // 3
    }
    helperRecursiveFn(arr);
    return result;
}

oddArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]);
// OutPut -> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
```
Here the recursive function is helperRecursiveFn.
1. Return if the array length is 0.
2. Push the element to result array if the element is odd.
3. Call helperRecursiveFn with **first element of array sliced**. Every time the first element of array will be sliced, because we have already cheked it for odd or even.

For ex: First time helperRecursiveFn will be called with **`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`**. Next time it will be called with **`[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`** and so on untill the array length is 0. 

### <a name="linear-search">Linear Search Algorithm</a>
Linear search algorithm is pretty simple. Say that you need to find if a number exists in a given array or not.

You will run a simple for loop and check every element untill you find the one you are looking for.

```js
const array = [3, 8, 12, 6, 10, 2];

// Find 10 in the given array.
function checkForN(arr, n) {
	for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		if (n === array[i]) {
			return `${true} ${n} exists at index ${i}`;
		}
	}

  return `${false} ${n} does not exist in the given array.`;
}

checkForN(array, 10);
```

That's linear search algorithm. You search for each element in the array one by one in a linear manner.

![linear-search-algorithm](./linear-search.svg)

#### Time Complexity of Linear Search Algorithm
There is only one for loop which will run n times. Where n (in worst case) is the length of the given array. Here number of iterations (in worst case) is directly propotional to the input (array of length).

Hence the time complexity for linear search algorithm is **Linear Time Complexity: O(n)**.

### <a name="binary-search">Binary Search Algorithm</a>
In linear search you can eliminate one element at a time. But with binary search algorithm you can eliminate multiple elements at once. That's why binary search is faster than linear search.

<blockquote><strong>The point to be noted here is that binary search works only on sorted array</strong>.</blockquote>

This algorithm follows divide and conquer approach. Let find the index of 8 in [2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12].

**Step 1:**
Find the middleIndex of the array.
```js
const array = [2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12];
let firstIndex = 0;
let lastIndex = array.length - 1;
let middleIndex = Math.floor((firstIndex + lastIndex) / 2); // middleIndex -> 2
```

**Step 2:**
Check if middleIndex element > 8. If so, that means 8 is on the left of middleIndex. Hence, change lastIndex to (middleIndex - 1).

**Step 3:**
Else if middleIndex element < 8. That means 8 is on the right of middleIndex. Hence, change firstIndex to (middleIndex + 1);
```js
if (array[middleIndex] > 8) {
	lastIndex = middleIndex - 1;
} else {
	firstIndex = middleIndex + 1;
}
```

**Step 4:**
With every iteration middleIndex is again set as per the new firstIndex or lastIndex.

Let's see all those steps together in code format.

```js
function binarySearch(array, element) {
	let firstIndex = 0;
	let lastIndex = array.length - 1;
	let middleIndex = Math.floor((firstIndex + lastIndex) / 2);
	
	while (array[middleIndex] !== element && firstIndex <= lastIndex) {
		if(array[middleIndex] > element) {
				lastIndex = middleIndex - 1;
		}else {
				firstIndex = middleIndex + 1;
		}
		middleIndex = Math.floor((firstIndex + lastIndex) / 2);
	}
	return array[middleIndex] === element ? middleIndex : -1;
}

const array = [2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12];
binarySearch(array, 8); // OutPut -> 3
```

Here is visual representation of the above code.

**Step: 1**
![binary-search-1](./binary-search1.svg)
```js
firstIndex = middleIndex + 1;
```

**Step: 2**
![binary-search-1](./binary-search2.svg)
```js
lastIndex = middleIndex - 1;
```

**Step: 3**
![binary-search-1](./binary-search3.svg)
```js
array[middleIndex] === 8 // Found It
```


#### Time Complexity of Binary Search
There is only one while loop which will run n times. But here number of iterations does not depend on the input (array length).

Hence the time complexity for binary search algorithm is **Logarithmic Time Complexity: O(log n)**. And you can check the O-notation graph. O(log n) is faster than O(n).

## DataStructure
### <a name="what-is-ds">What is DataStructure and why to care?</a>
DataStructure is the way to organize your data. Different operations (CRUD) performs better with different DataStructures.

So, it is very important to know which DS is right for a particular use case.
