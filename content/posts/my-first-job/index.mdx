excerpt: How I got my first dev job as a college drop out without a CS degree and why I left it.
---
Recently I left my Software Engineer job at a consulting firm. This was my first job and this is my story on why I left it.

## How I got my first dev job.
I don't have a CS degree or any other degree for that matter as I dropped out of my college the very first year in 2018 to work on my Idea.

The idea is to fix the reason, because of which I dropped out. Well, that's a different story.

For the next 1.5 years, I learned basic programming on my own from the internet. Based on that learning I was selected for a programming boot camp (AltCampus) in June 2019.

6 months down the line I was a full-stack MERN developer.

Jan 2020 got a job offer, but the company demanded to learn Ruby On Rails. So, went out of the comfort zone learned a new technology in two months, and joined the company.

## Why I left the job.
My intention to learn to program was never to get a job, I just did it for some exposure. But soon realized I won't survive here. As the nature of my job was very repetitive, it felt more like doing labor work than programming.

Talked with senior management, they said and I quote:

<blockquote>We know the work is boring, repetitive, and you are not learning something new, but someone has to do it.</blockquote>

Somehow, I stretched for a year and left as my sanity is more important than money.

Now, you might say it was a bad decision, I should have stayed to gain some experience. See, I don't know if it was a good or a bad decision, but all I can do now is try to make this decision right.

I would not have left if I would have been financially unhealthy. But my family is doing just fine and I think I can take my chance as I don't have any responsibilities on my shoulders at this point.

## Getting my hands dirty
I am a bit skeptical about sharing this but let's just do it anyway.

I have tried a few small things here and there in the last 1 year to get my hands dirty in building and selling products. Here are 2 of them.

### 1. Learnist
In 2020 every week I use to discuss programming stuff with two of my friends over zoom. One day I thought why not get more people involved in this discussion.

So, we created a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thelearnist) and set up a basic [website](https://learnist.netlify.app/). And we were able to get 50-60 people showing up in one of the sessions.

Managed around 6-7 awesome sessions. But then we stopped, don't know why but we just stopped. I guess because none of us were serious about it.

### 2. Email Templates
Apr, 2021 - Tried to build and sell email templates, but failed, and [here is why](https://swastikyadav.com/i-launched-my-first-product-and-it-failed).

## The plan ahead.
It's been over a year I haven't touched the MERN stack. So, going back to it. And after that will start working on my idea.

After leaving the job, I have been reading and learning a lot about content creation, building products, and startups.

I am documenting it all and my learnings on Twitter. So, [follow me there](https://twitter.com/codeSwastik) if you think I can be of some value to you.
