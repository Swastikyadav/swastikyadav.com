I am always reading and learning new stuff, which helps me develop my insights and thoughts. Hence, building VisionMad NewsLetter in public to share my insights and learnings weekly.

Here is how I plan to implement it. I kept it dam simple, no big talks and buzz words, only actionable and practical steps crafted after giving hours and days of thoughts behind it.

Divide my working hours into three equal slots: LBS
Learn, Build, and Share.

Learning in public
My interest is in learning all sorts of skills that we were never taught in schools, but are essential for life. I don't know how to do my taxes, apply for a loan, purchase a home, things about investment, building credit, or getting a job.

What is school for?

I want to have a deep understanding of the following.
Algorithm / Programming
Animation / Html Canvas
Science / Mathematics
Writing / StoryTelling
Marketing / SEO
Design
It's going to be a life long journey to keep learning and keep sharing.

Building in public
For the first time, I am building a newsletter. So, if I reach 100 subscribers in the next three months, I will consider it a success.

The name of the newsletter is VisionMad, which stands for Vision to Make A Difference.

My blog is using GatsbyJS and, free version of ConvertKit for NewsLetter. I will shift to paid versions once I start seeing some real potential with VisionMad. 

Distribution Channels
I have done my research, and this is where most people fail. People mostly spend 90% time creating content and only 10% distributing it. The ratio for creation and distribution should be 50:50.
SEO - Learning basics of SEO. I will start implementing it soon.
Twitter - Long-form content sharing. Commenting and engaging on others' tweets.
IndieHacker - Long-form content sharing. Commenting and engaging on others' posts. 
LinkedIn - Link sharing with images and GIF. Organic reach is good. Using hashtags properly can do wonders.
Facebook - Providing value to specific groups and pages with a direct link to the newsletter.
Quora - Posting detailed answers to related questions, letting them know about the newsletter in a humble tone.
Podcast - Convert the blog post to audio and publish on Anchor.
YouTube - Convert the podcast audio to video and upload.
Inspiration for the distribution strategy came from a lot of readings. Here is one of the resource: 

I understand that I might fail, and I am ready for it. Anyway, in the end, I will have the experience to share.

All suggestions and feedback are welcome. Thanks for reading.
