Recently I have been trying to connect ReactJS with Rails application. And I did not found any proper resource on the internet, So I decided to write one.

We will not be using rails as an API, but will render react component instead of rails default view.

## Installing ReactJS in Rails application

1. Add gem `react-rails` to your Gemfile.

```ruby
gem 'react-rails'
```

2. Execute `bundle install`

```bash
$ bundle install
```

3. Now to create components folder in `app/javascript` directory run the following three commands in your terminal.

```bash
$ rails webpacker:install
$ rails webpacker:install:react
$ rails generate react:install
```

That's all, you need to do in order to use ReactJS with your rails application.

## Connecting react component with rails view

Rails application will work normally, we will just render react component instead of rails default view.

Let's say we have a greetings controller and we want to render a greeting react component.

Controller: `app/controllers/greetings_controller.rb`

```ruby
class GreetingsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    render
  end
end
```

Views: `app/views/greetings/show.html.erb`

```html
<%= react_component('Greeting', greet: "Hello World!") %>
```

React: `app/javascript/components/Greeting.js`

```js
import React from 'react'

function Greeting(props) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{props.greet}</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the React-Rails world!</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default Greeting
```

And, you are done. You just rendered a react component instead of rails default view.

## Configuring JS-Routes

JS-Routes helps you to access the rails routes in your JavaScript files.

To configure JS-Routes, follow the link given below. Because the official docs of JS-Routes are outdated.

**[Configuring JS-Routes](https://github.com/railsware/js-routes/issues/237#issuecomment-409167952)**

## Using JS-Routes in react component

After following the steps from the above link, you can use JS-Routes in your react components like this, `Routes.dashboard_path()`. Replace dashboard_path() with your desired rails route.

For example:

```js
import React from 'react';

function Example() {
  function handleLogout() {
    fetch(Routes.logout_path(), {
      method: "DELETE"
    });
  }

  ...
}

export default Example;
```

That's how you connect react with rails in a server side rendered application. I hope it was helpful for you.
