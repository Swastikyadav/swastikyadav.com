There is nothing more satisfying than building great products that entice your users.

However, building a great product requires more than just coding or designing, and that's what I'm learning these days.

I am one of those people who believe in building great products at great speed.

Every time I build a product, I feel overwhelmed by the numerous UI/UX options available for layout, spacing, typography, and color.

Hence, I created a minimal component library for myself, which follows a specific set of rules to avoid being overwhelmed.

Introducing: [**Catalyst UI**](https://catalystui.vercel.app) - _A React components library for faster product prototyping_.

Read the design system here: [The Design System](https://catalystui.vercel.app/documentation/design-system)

Every CatalystUI component, block, and template follows this design system.

CatalystUI doesn't force you to follow this design system strictly. You can break the rules if you've a good reason to do so with simple TailwindCSS utility classes.

This is built with React, TailwindCSS, and RadixUI.

RadixUI is the core building block of this design system. Unstyled, Accessible, and Open-source React primitives.

Let's break down one simple component from CatalystUI.

## Avatar component breakdown

RadixUI Avatar comes in three parts:

- Avatar.Root: The root element
- Avatar.Image: The element that takes the image URL
- Avatar.Fallback: The element which renders name initials if the image URL is not given or can't be fetched

Here is the basic usage.

```tsx
<Avatar.Root>
  <Avatar.Image src={imageUrl} />
  <Avatar.Fallback>SW<Avatar.Fallback />
<Avatar.Root>
```

This renders a completely unstyled Avatar, one that doesn't even look like an avatar. So that we can style it however we want. And that's not a bug but a feature of RadixUI Primitives.

We'll create three different components for each part of the avatar.

- Use children props to render `Avatar.Image` and `Avatar.Fallback` into `Avatar.Root`.
- Style each part with TailwindCSS.

```tsx
const AvatarRoot = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Root>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Root>
>(({ className, children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
  return (
    <AvatarPrimitive.Root
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={cx(className)}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </AvatarPrimitive.Root>
  );
});

const AvatarImage = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Image>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Image> & {
    imgUrl: string;
  }
>(({ imgUrl, className, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
  return (
    <AvatarPrimitive.Image
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={cx(
        // base
        "w-[26px] h-[26px] rounded-full cursor-pointer",
        // className prop
        className
      )}
      src={imgUrl}
      alt="Colm Tuite"
      {...props}
    />
  );
});

const AvatarFallback = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Image>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Image>
>(({ className, children, ...props }, forwardedRef) => {
  return (
    <AvatarPrimitive.Fallback
      ref={forwardedRef}
      className={cx(
        // base
        "cursor-pointer border border-gray-200 rounded-full p-1",
        // className prop
        className
      )}
      delayMs={600}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </AvatarPrimitive.Fallback>
  );
});
```

Now, our Avatar component is ready to be used. Here is the usage.

```tsx
<AvatarRoot>
  <AvatarImage imgUrl="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44374494" />
  <AvatarFallback>SW</AvatarFallback>
</AvatarRoot>
```

Similarly, other components are also built with some API differences. Radix doesn't have primitives for everything, so for other things, we can use the Slot utility from Radix to get its accessibility benefits into our custom primitives.
