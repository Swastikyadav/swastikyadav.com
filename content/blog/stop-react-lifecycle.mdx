In this post let's talk about the paradigm shift from lifecycle methods to state synchronization and hooks in ReactJs.

When class components were a thing in ReactJs (Well it still is, but no one likes them anymore), we use to think a lot in terms of mouting, unmounting, and lifecycle methods.

Whenever a class component mounts, the lifecycle methods are called in following sequence: constructor â†’ render â†’ DOM and refs update â†’ componentDidMount

But then came React Hooks, and we started to think in terms of dependency array.

And, often times we ask:

> What is the hooksÂ equivalentÂ toÂ [some lifecycle method]?

The quick answer is that hooks are a paradigm shift from thinking in terms of "lifecycles" to thinking in terms of "state and synchronization with DOM".

![lifecycles!=hoooks](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/j2t7c1ymoiavzdjci11m.png)

Trying to take the old paradigm and apply it to hooks just doesn't work out very well and can hold you back.

```js
useEffect(fn); // fn invoked on all updates

useEffect(fn, []); // invoked on mount

useEffect(fn, [a, b, c]); // invoked if any of the members of the array are updated
```

The above snippet is not the right way to think about React hook.

Lifecycles are gone, but we still think of useEffect with empty dep array as componentDidMount, and thatâ€™s not the right way to think about React Hooks.

Now I want to present to you the right way to think about react hooks.

## State Synchronization

See, the question is not "when does this effect run" the question is "which state does this effect synchronizes with"

```js
useEffect(fn); // useEffect with no dep array, sync with all state

useEffect(fn, []); // useEffect with empty dep array, sync with no state

useEffect(fn, [stateA, stateB]); // useEffect with stateA and stateB in dep array sync with stateA and stateB.
```

And thatâ€™s how you should think about React Hooks.
