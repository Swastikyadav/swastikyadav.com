Hello Devs!

When we work with NextJs, some of our code is running on the server, some is running on the client.

So the first natural question that comes to mind is "What is the difference?". So that's what we are going to discuss today.

- Client Component: Essentially the same React component that we are already familiar with.
- Server Component: Bends the rules of traditional component a little bit. Provides some extra features that we will looak at later in this post.

Another question that may arise is "Which one to use when?".

Well, as a rule of thumb in NextJs we should generally go for **server component first**, then if you feel the need of hooks or event handlers, move to **client component later**.

## Server Components

Let's discuss some features and limitations of server components.

### Features

- By default in NextJs all components are server components.
- Tons of UX, performance, etc benefits by using them.
- Can use **async/await**! Don't need useState or useEffect for data fetching.

### Limitations

- Can not use any kind of hook.
- Can not assign any event handlers like onClick, onBlur, and etc.

And because server components are rendered on the server, all the JavaScript inside it works flawlessly even in systems where Js can't run or is disabled.

And this provides a huge performance boost as we are not relying on users system to run JavaScript.

## Client Component

The same old React component here are some features and limitations.

### Features

- Created by addign 'use client' at the very top of the file.
- Have all the usual rules of components. Can use Hooks, Event handlers, etc.

### Limitations

- Can not directly show a server component.

So, I repeat again use a client component if you need to use hooks or event handlers.

## Does Client component actually renders on the client? Or we have been tricked?

The client component for the very first time render on the server instead of client.

Wait What?... But it is called **"Client Component"**. Right?

Ya, although it is called client component, but it does not render on the client 100% of the time.

For the very first time when user requests a page, the client component renders on the server.

This is really very important to understand because you'll be able to catch and avoid many nasty bugs if you understand this distinction beforehand.

## Server Actions

Alright, we understood that server components can not use hooks or event handlers. Then the question is "How do we submit a form in server component?".

Well, the answer is just like how we submit a form in plain old vanilla HTML.

Let's see an example.

```js
// An example server component.

export default function PostCreatePage() {
  async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
    "use server";

    // validate + sanitize user input.
    // create a new post in database.
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={createPost}>
      <input type="text" placeholder="topic" />
      <textArea type="text" placeholder="content" />
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

The server actions stays and executes on the server.

The `formData` argument in createPost server action is the default formData we receive when submiting a form.
