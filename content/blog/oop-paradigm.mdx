Hello Everyone,

In this post we will explore the **object oriented programming** paradigm in JavaScript. OOP is a paradigm where everything is managed with objects.

There are four ways to work with objects in JavaScript:

- Factory way of creating objects.
- Prototypal way of creating objects.
- Pseudo Classical pattern of creating objects.
- Classes

The best way to work with objects are classes. We will learn exactly how classes works. Let's explore each method one by one.

## Factory way of creating objects

Let's say we need to create multiple students object. With factory way, we don't manually need to create objects for all of them. We create a constructor function.

```js
function creteStudent(name, batch, marks, maxMarks) {
  let obj = {};
  obj.name = name;
  obj.batch = batch;
  obj.marks = marks;
  obj.maxMarks = maxMarks;
  obj.percentage = function () {
    return `${(marks * 100) / maxMarks}%`;
  };

  return obj;
}
```

Next whenever we need to create a student, we just have to call the above function.

```js
let student1 = createStudent("Swastik", 9, 95, 100);
let student2 = createStudent("Rahul", 8, 90, 100);

student1.percentage(); // 95%
```

This was the factory way of creating objects.

## Prototypal way of creating objects

When a property is not found in an object, it looks for it down in the prototypal chain. This is the **prototypal nature of object**.

Now let's create object the prototypal way.

1. Create object using **Object.create()**.
2. Make sure to use **this** in the method.
3. Make sure to return object.

```js
let studentMethod = {
  percentage: function () {
    return `${(this.marks * 100) / this.maxMarks}%`;
  },
};

function createStudent(name, batch, marks, maxMarks) {
  let obj = Object.create(studentMethod);
  obj.name = name;
  obj.batch = batch;
  obj.marks = marks;
  obj.maxMarks = maxMarks;

  return obj;
}

let student1 = createStudent("Swastik", 9, 99, 100);
student1.percentage(); // 99%
```

Object.create takes an object as parameter and puts that parameter into dunder-proto. For example in the above code snippet percentage method is added in dunder proto, it is not in the main object.

## Pseudo Classical pattern of creating objects

Pseudo classical pattern uses the **new** keyword with constructor function to create objects. The new keyword does 3 things.

1. Creates a new object implicitly, named **this**.
2. Puts the new object (this) in function prototype.
3. Implicitly returns obj (this).

When we use **new** keyword, methods from prototype goes to dunder-proto.

1. this = {}
2. this.**proto** = createStudent.prototype
3. return obj (this)

For instance:

```js
function CreateStudent(name, batch, marks, maxMarks) {
  this.name = name;
  this.batch = batch;
  this.marks = marks;
  this.maxMarks = maxMarks;
}

CreateStudent.prototype = {
  percentage: function () {
    return `${(this.marks * 100) / this.maxMarks}%`;
  },
};

let student1 = new CreateStudent("Swastik", 9, 100, 100);
student1.percentage(); // 100%
```

The **new** keyword implicitly creates the object, sets the method to dunder-proto, and implicitly returns the object.

## Classes

Classes are a syntactic sugar to create objects. In the last example we added the percentage method to CreateStudent.prototype manually. With classes all that is done automatically.

- The **new** keyword calls the constructor and implicitly creates and returns the **this** object.
- Classes accepts only methods (functions).
- You will find the methods in the dunder-proto of the object.

For instace:

```js
class CreateStudent {
  constructor(name, batch, marks, maxMarks) {
    this.name = name;
    this.batch = batch;
    this.marks = marks;
    this.maxMarks = maxMarks;
  }

  percentage() {
    return `${(this.marks * 100) / this.maxMarks}%`;
  }
}

let student1 = new CreateStudent("Swastik", 9, 89, 100);
student1.percentage(); // 89%
student1.percentage === CreateStudent.prototype.percentage; // true
```

So, that's how we create objects with classes. Enumerable flag for class methods are by default set to false, because we don't want methods in [**for...in**](https://dev.to/swastikyadav/difference-between-forof-and-forin-loop-in-javascript-j2o) loop result.

### Class Inheritance

Class inheritance is a way to create new functionality on top of existing one. Let's say we have an Animal class and a Rabbit class based on Animal class.

```js
// Animal Class
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.speed = 0;
    this.name = name;
  }

  run(speed) {
    this.speed = speed;
    alert(`${this.name} runs with speed ${this.speed}.`);
  }

  stop() {
    this.speed = 0;
    alert(`${this.name} stands still.`);
  }
}

let animal = new Animal("My animal");

// Rabbit Class
class Rabbit extends Animal {
  hide() {
    alert(`${this.name} hides!`);
  }
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit");

rabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.
rabbit.hide(); // White Rabbit hides!
```

Rabbit class does not have run method but it can access it from Animal.prototype as we have extended Rabbit class.

### The Super keyword

The super keyword allows us to call parent method and constructor in our extended class.

- **super.method(...)** calls a parent method.
- **super(...)** calls parent constructor.

For instance:

```js
class Rabbit extends Animal {
  constructor() {
    super(); // calls the parent constructor
  }

  hide() {
    alert(`${this.name} hides`);
  }

  stop() {
    super.stop(); // calls stop method of parent
    this.hide();
  }
}

let rabbit = new Rabbit("White Rabbit");

rabbit.run(5); // White Rabbit runs with speed 5.
rabbit.stop(); // White Rabbit stands still. White Rabbit hides!
```

In the above code snippet, Rabbit class defines a stop method which calls the stop method of Animal with super.

### The static method

We can also assign a method to the class itself, not to its "prototype". Such methods are called static methods. They are prepended by **static** keyword.

```js
class User {
  static staticMethod() {
    console.log(this === User);
  }
}

User.staticMethod(); // true
```

Static methods are used for functionality that belongs to the class "as a whole". It does not relate to a concrete class instance.

Static properties and methods are inherited. For class B extends A the prototype of the **class B itself points to A: B.[[Prototype]] = A**. So if a field is not found in B, the search continues in A.

### Private and protected properties and methods

- **Protected** fields starts with **\_**. Protected field should only be accessible from its class and classes inheriting from it. Protected field is not supported at the language level.
- **Private** fields starts with **#**. Private field should only be accessibe from inside the class.

```js
class CoffeeMachine {
  #waterAmount = 0;

  set waterAmount(value) {
    if (value < 0) {
      value = 0;
    }
    this.#waterAmount = value;
  }

  get waterAmount() {
    return this.#waterAmount;
  }

  constructor(power) {
    this.power = power;
  }
}

let coffeeMachine1 = new CoffeeMachine(100);
coffeeMachine1.#waterAmount; // Error - Private method cannot be accessed outside of the class.
coffeeMachine1.waterAmount; // 0;
coffeeMachine1.waterAmount = -20;
coffeeMachine1.waterAmount; // 0;
```

Private method #waterAmount is only accessible inside the class itself.

## The this keyword

The **this** keyword refers to the object it belongs to. There are four rules to identify, where the this keyword is refering.

1. fn() -> window
2. obj.fn() -> this referes to obj. If any function is using **this** then **this** becomes the object at left of (.).
3. bind, call, apply -> "this" value is specified.
4. new keyword creates and returns this implicitly.

**"this"** changes at runtime.
