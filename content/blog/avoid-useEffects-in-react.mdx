Most React developers rely on `useEffect` for almost everything, especially beginners. I was the same untill I had a heated argument over it and read the official React docs.

I literally use to think in `useEffect` only. For me it was like:

> Many problems (data fetching, focusing an input, state updates when something changes), one solution (useEffect).

Now, I'm out of the `useEffect` way of thinking. And my goal with post is to help you do the same.

But first we must understand pure components.

## Pure components

A component must be pure, meaning:

- **Same inputs, Same output**. Given the same inputs, a component should always return the same JSX.
- A component should not mutate/change any variables/inputs that existed before its rendering.

So, keep mutations local and rendering function pure.

### Example:

```js
export default function DayNight({ time }) {
  let hours = time.getHours();
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    document.getElementById("time").className = "night";
  } else {
    document.getElementById("time").className = "day";
  }

  return <h1 id="time">{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>;
}
```

The above component is not pure because it performs a side effect (modifying the DOM).

### Solution:

This can be made pure by calculating the className and including in the render output.

```js
export default function DayNight({ time }) {
  let hours = time.getHours();
  let className;
  if (hours >= 0 && hours <= 6) {
    className = "night";
  } else {
    className = "day";
  }

  return <h1 className={className}>{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>;
}
```

The side effect (modifying the DOM) was not necessary at all. You only need to return JSX.

And no, you don't need a state to hold className value and a useEffect to change it.

## Avoid Effects

### What are effects?

Effects are a way to step outside of React and sync our component with external systems without making it impure.

Avoiding unnecessary Effects will make our code easier to follow, faster to run, and less error-prone.

If there is no external system involved, we shouldn't need an Effect.

Let's see some examples:

### Bad examples:

```js
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("Swastik");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Yadav");

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: redundant state and unnecessary effect.
  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    setFullName(firstName + " " + lastName);
  }, [firstName, lastName]);

  // ...
}
```

```js
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: redundant and unnecessary effect.
  const [visibleTodos, setVisibleTodos] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    setVisibleTodos(filterTodosFun(todos, filter));
  }, [todos, filter]);
}
```

These are more complicated than necessary. It does an entire render with stale value for `fullName`, then immediately re-renders with the updated value.

### Good Examples:

```js
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("Swastik");
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("Yadav");

  // âœ… Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

  // ...
}
```

```js
function TodoList({ todos, filter }) {
  const [newTodo, setNewTodo] = useState("");

  // âœ… This is fine
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => {
    // âœ… Does not re-run unless todos or filter change
    return filterTodosFun(todos, filter);
  }, [todos, filter]);
}
```

When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don't put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering.

- Avoid extra "cascading" updates.
- Avoid bugs created by different state variables getting out of sync.

### Let's see more examples:

This `ProfilePage` component receives a userId prop. The page contains a comment input.

When we navigate from one profile to another, the comment state should reset.

```js
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState("");

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an effect.
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment("");
  }, [userId]);

  // ...
}
```

This is inefficient because profilePage and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again.

Instead tell React that each user's profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key. Split component in two and pass a key attribute from outer component to inner one.

```js
  export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
    return (
      <Profile userId={userId} key={userId} />;
    );
  };

  function Profile({ userId }) {
    // âœ… This and any other state below will reset on key change automatically
    const [comment, setComment] = useState("");

    // ...
  };
```

By passing `userId` as `key` to the Profile component, React treats two profile component with different `userId` as two different components that should not share any state.

### One more example:

Reset the `selection` to `null` whenever the `items` prop changes.

ðŸ”´ Wrong:

```js
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in a effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);

  // ...
}
```

- Every time items change.
- List and childrens re-render with stale state.
- Then again re-render because of useEffect.
- Restarting the whole process.

Adjusting state based on porps or other state makes our data flow more difficult to understand and debug.

Always check if we can:

- Reset all state with key.
- Calculate everything during rendering.

âœ… Best

```js
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);

  // âœ… Best: Calculate everything during rendering
  const selection = items.find((item) => item.id === selectedId) ?? null;

  // ...
}
```

## Takeaways

Now, if there is only one thing you can take away from this post. It shoudl be the following.

- If you can calculate something during render, you don't need and effect.
- To reset the state of an entire component tree, pass a differetn `key` to it.
- Code that runs because a component was displayed should be in effects, the rest should be in events.

Here is the flow in which you should think about implementation.

> Rendering â†’ Events â†’ Split Comp in two (use `key`) â†’ Effects (last resort).
